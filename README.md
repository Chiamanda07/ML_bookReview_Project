# 📚 Book Review Sentiment Classifier

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a book review is **positive** or **negative** based on its text.

## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to build a simple sentiment analysis model that can predict the **sentiment** of book reviews. Using a labeled dataset of reviews, the model learns to distinguish between positive and negative feedback using natural language processing techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Logistic Regression**

## 🧠 Model

- The model was trained using a **Logistic Regression classifier**.
- Input: Raw book reviews (text)
- Output: Sentiment label (`Positive` or `Negative`)
- Text data was preprocessed using **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical features.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved strong performance on the test set.
- Metrics like **accuracy** were used to evaluate the model.
